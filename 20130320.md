So what did we do last week?

[Ulrich](http://www.theodi.org/people/ulrich-atz) joined the team and spent most of the week getting up to speed. [Tom](http://www.theodi.org/people/tom-heath) spoke at the LGA event “Making transparency work for you” in Bristol, which was "a great update to some of the things being done with open data at a local level", while [Stuart](http://www.theodi.org/people/stuart-harrison) learnt a bunch of new Ruby tricks while trying to integrate some of our stuff with CapsuleCRM, learning in the process that "some of the things I did that I thought were horrible hacks were actually OK!". [I](http://www.theodi.org/people/sam-pikesley) spent Friday and Saturday at the excellent [DevOpsDays London](http://devopsdays.org/events/2013-london/) conference.

As a team, we had some interesting discussions around URI design, creating useful data, schemas and so on, and started having regular catchups to help us catch and solve problems early (not on the last day of the Sprint!)
